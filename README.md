# NN_Classification_Project_LendingClub
This notebook looks at analyzing some loan information from a kaggle dataset from LendingClub. The goal of this notebook is to create a classification neural network that is able to accurately predict whether an individual would recieve the loan they applied for or if the loan application would be rejected. We would like to create such a model to determine if the individual would be able to pay back their loan to the lender so that the lender's investment will not be forfeit. Contents within the notebook include data visualization & analysis, data preprocessing, and finally building our neural network model inside of the TensorFlow package.
